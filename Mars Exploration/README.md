# Mars Exploration

## Problem
Sami's spaceship crashed on Mars! She sends `n` sequential `SOS` messages to Earth for help.

Letters in some of the `SOS` messages are altered by cosmic radiation during transmission. Given the signal received by Earth as a string, `S`, determine how many letters of Sami's `SOS` have been changed by radiation.

#### Input Format
There is one line of input: a single string, `S`.

**Note:** As the original message is just `SOS` repeated `n` times, `S`'s length will be a multiple of `3`.

#### Constraints
* `1 < |S| < 99`
* `|S| % 3 = 0`
* `S` will contain only uppercase English letters.

#### Output Format
Print the number of letters in Sami's message that were altered by cosmic radiation.
